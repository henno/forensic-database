    <h2>Forex Fraud Case Summary for Koit Ortus</h2>
    <p>
        This portal documents evidence for a client who was scammed by Forex fraudsters. The victim needs to provide evidence to his bank, Revolut, to prove that he was scammed but was not able to gather the evidence due to lack of technical knowledge and English which is why he turned to us for help. We (Diara Infra OÜ) created this portal to help him gather the evidence. The scam began with a fake news article posted to his Facebook feed via paid ads, redirecting to websites that mimicked reputable news sources. These sites featured prominent figures endorsing an app for passive income. After registering, the client received phone calls from fraudsters who guided him to transfer money to various websites like allpaysoft.io, digainvest.com, and besttrade4you.com. His bank intervened and closed his accounts, but Revolut now requests evidence. This portal shows which sites were visited during calls and allows to upload additional files, such as images drawn by scammers and videos recorded during scam calls.

        Evidence was gathered as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>Call Log Analytics v2.1.6 was installed on Koit's Android phone. Then that app's export functionality was used to export all his calls between 2025-06-05 and 2025-06-23. The CSV file was uploaded to his Google Drive and downloaded to his computer.</li>
            <li>LibreOffice Calc was used to open the CSV file and remove any personal calls unrelated to the case. The resulting CSV file was saved as a new CSV file as calls.csv.</li>
            <li>The browser history was exported from Google Takeout as JSON file</li>
            <li>An app was written to clean the browser history from unrelated entries and show the result as pretty HTML file</li>
            <li>The app was extended to read data from a sqlite database instead. Import scripts were written to import the calls.csv and cleaned browser history JSON into the database</li>
            <li>The app was extended to allow adding annotations to browser history entries and uploading images.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> The following is the result of that.</p>
    <p>Browser history entry titles have been translated to English (the original title is in the tooltip).</p>
         <p>The browser entries that are <span style="font-weight: bold;">in bold</span> contain annotations which can be seen by expanding the row.</p>
    <p>All times are in UTC!</p>

    We managed to film one call with the scammer at 2025-06-23 when Koit was instructed by the police to stall the scammer. The video is here:
