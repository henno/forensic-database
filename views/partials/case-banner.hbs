    <h2>Forex Fraud Case Summary</h2>
    <p>
        This portal documents evidence for a client who was scammed by Forex fraudsters. The scam began with a fake news article posted to his Facebook feed via paid ads, redirecting to websites that mimicked reputable news sources. These sites featured prominent figures endorsing an app for passive income. After registering, the client received phone calls from fraudsters who guided him to transfer money to suspicious websites and take quick loans, funneling funds into a controlled forex account. His bank intervened and closed his accounts, but Revolut now requests evidence. This portal shows which sites were visited during calls and allows the admin to upload additional files, such as images drawn by scammers and videos recorded during scam calls.
